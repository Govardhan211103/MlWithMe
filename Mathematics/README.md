# Mathematics For Machine Learning

Understanding mathematics is essential to master machine learning. It acts as the foundation, helping us grasp how ML models function. Think of it as the language machines use to communicate. Intelligent models are crafted using intricate mathematical equations. These equations come in various types, like finding relationships between random attributes, measuring similarity among attributes, or explaining the importance of different features. Almost everything in creating these smart models relies on mathematics.

Developing these models and equations required significant groundwork by great researchers. However, the entire complex process becomes much clearer when you have a good grasp of basic mathematics. This understanding is especially valuable if you're enthusiastic about conducting your own research.

I would suggest you to read some of the books ðŸ“š  
- ["Mathematics for MachineLearning"](https://mml-book.github.io/) which has great information about LinearAlg,  Probability and a perfect pair for beginners.
- ["Practical Statistic for DataScientists"](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-statistics-for/9781491952955/) the best to get a strong hold on Statistics for ML.

Referring to books will help you out in all the situations. Go through the content in this repo whenever you get stuck stop and refer that topic in some book then come back here and continue. Believe me or not once you start reading a book you will get addicted to it ðŸ˜‚.

## Math Implementation with Python Libraries

We'll explore some Python libraries that are essential for implementing mathematical concepts in practice. These libraries are crucial for our journey into machine learning and model development.
- **Numpy** : A powerful library for array operations, linear algebra, and matrices.
- **Pandas** : Useful for working with datasets, offering functions for data analysis, cleaning, exploration, and manipulation.
- **Other Libraries** : **Matplotlib**, **SciPy**, **Seaborn** etc., (To be discussed in future modules).

These libraries will play a key role in turning mathematical concepts into practical implementations for machine learning. 


## Components of Mathematics in ML:

### 1. LinearAlgebra
To start learning math for ML, begin with linear algebra. It's the fundamental math that addresses how to represent data and perform computations in machine learning models. Linear algebra involves arrays, technically known as vectors, matrices, and tensors. Understanding these concepts lays the groundwork for delving deeper into the mathematical aspects of machine learning.

- [LinearAlgebra2](LinearAlgebra2.ipynb) : Matrix operations in Linear Algebra.

### 2. Probability
Probability explores uncertainty, a key aspect in ML. Understanding probabilities aids in making informed decisions, crucial for various ML tasks.

### 3. Statistics
Statistics involves analyzing and interpreting data. In ML, statistical methods are employed to draw meaningful insights and conclusions from datasets.

### 4. Calculus
Calculus is the mathematics of change and motion. In ML, it plays a vital role in optimization algorithms, enabling models to learn and improve over time.


Diving into each component equips you with the tools needed to navigate the intricate landscape of machine learning. As you explore these topics, remember that a solid foundation in mathematics enhances your ability to innovate and contribute meaningfully to the field. Happy learning! ðŸš€ðŸ“Š
